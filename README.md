# Vim Customization **[MAC/LINUX]**

## Hey Folks üëã

We all love an awesome UI. So I‚Äôve been wondering how to make my vim colorful. As you all know by default vim has no color for syntax(like in IDEs we see different colors for variable names, contant, function name etc.) you will see only single color in whole file, which is so boring and its a downside. And I personally dont like this. So after digging and reading some articles I was able to do my own customization its not a rocket science. üòÅ

#### For linux ONLY

Run this in your terminal and sit back and relax. Please ensure **gcc** and **git** is install before running this command.

    $ bash path/to/customizeVim.sh
